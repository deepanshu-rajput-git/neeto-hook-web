Project Status Report: NeetoWebhooks

  ---


  1. Executive Summary


  The foundational architecture of NeetoWebhooks has been successfully established. The Rails backend is operational in
  API-only mode, connected to a PostgreSQL database. The React frontend is set up with Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS.
  Core features like live webhook inspection, history, and real-time updates via Action Cable are implemented. A basic
  version of payload transformation is also functional.


  The project is now at a stage where development can shift from the core setup to implementing the key business logic and
  user-facing features that define the product's value proposition.

  2. Completed Features


  The following features have been implemented and are considered functional:


   * âœ… Backend: Ruby on Rails (API-only) with a PostgreSQL database.
   * âœ… Frontend: React with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
   * âœ… Real-Time: Live updates on the dashboard using Action Cable.
   * âœ… Core - Unique URL: A central endpoint (/api/hooks) is available to receive webhook requests.
   * âœ… Core - Live Inspection: The dashboard displays incoming webhooks in real-time, showing method, IP, and a timestamp.
   * âœ… Core - Webhook History: The dashboard lists all received webhooks, which can be inspected individually.
   * âœ… Custom Logic - Payload Transformation: A UI and backend system exists to create and apply simple JavaScript-based
     payload transformations.

  3. Remaining Features

  The following is a detailed breakdown of features from the PRD that are yet to be implemented.


  Core Features
   * ðŸŸ¡ Retention Settings: The system currently stores webhooks indefinitely.
       * To-Do: Implement a mechanism (e.g., a background job) to delete webhook records based on configurable retention
         periods (7 days, 30 days).
   * ðŸ”´ Webhook History & Search: Basic history exists, but search is missing.
       * To-Do: Add a search bar to the dashboard to filter webhooks by content, headers, or status.


  Forwarding & Replaying
   * ðŸ”´ Forward to Destinations:
       * To-Do: Create models and UI to manage destination endpoints. Implement a job to forward incoming webhooks to these
         destinations.
   * ðŸ”´ Conditional Forwarding Logic:
       * To-Do: Extend the forwarding logic to allow users to define conditions (e.g., based on header values or payload
         content) for when a webhook should be forwarded.
   * ðŸ”´ Manual/Automated Replay:
       * To-Do: Add a "Replay" button to the webhook details view. Implement the backend logic to re-send a stored webhook
         request.


  Custom Logic
   * ðŸŸ¡ WebhookScript Editor: The current implementation only transforms the payload.
       * To-Do: Extend the script capabilities to allow modifying headers and returning custom mocked responses directly from
         the script.
   * ðŸ”´ Visual Editor:
       * To-Do: Design and build a no-code, drag-and-drop interface for creating transformation and forwarding rules.


  Local Tunnels
   * ðŸ”´ CLI Tool:
       * To-Do: Develop a command-line interface (potentially in Go, as suggested) that can create a secure tunnel to a
         user's local development server (e.g., localhost:4000).


  Mocking
   * ðŸ”´ Custom Mock API Endpoints:
       * To-Do: Implement a feature to let users define custom API endpoints within NeetoWebhooks that return predefined
         responses, status codes, and headers.


  Email & DNS Testing
   * ðŸ”´ Temporary Email Addresses:
       * To-Do: Set up a system to generate unique email addresses and display received emails.
   * ðŸ”´ DNS Endpoint Testing:
       * To-Do: Create a mechanism to test DNS-related webhook callbacks.


  Reliability
   * ðŸ”´ Automatic Retries:
       * To-Do: Implement a robust background job system (leveraging solid_queue) for automatic retries with exponential
         backoff for failed forwarding attempts.
   * ðŸ”´ Webhook Queue & Audit Log:
       * To-Do: Create a view to inspect the status of queued webhooks and an audit log for each request (e.g., forwarding
         attempts, transformations applied).
   * ðŸ”´ Configurable Retry Policies:
       * To-Do: Allow users to define custom retry policies (number of retries, backoff strategy) for each destination.


  Security
   * ðŸ”´ API Key-Based Access:
       * To-Do: Implement user authentication and generate API keys for programmatic access.
   * ðŸ”´ IP Whitelisting:
       * To-Do: Add the ability to restrict incoming requests to a list of allowed IP addresses.
   * ðŸ”´ Encrypted Payload Storage:
       * To-Do: Use Rails' built-in encryption (ActiveRecord::Encryption) to encrypt sensitive payload data at rest.
   * ðŸ”´ Audit Logs & Teams:
       * To-Do: Implement user and team management, with audit logs tracking all actions.


  Integrations
   * ðŸ”´ All Integrations:
       * To-Do: Implement connections and forwarding logic for each listed third-party service (Slack, Discord, Stripe,
         etc.).


  Branding & UI/UX
   * ðŸ”´ Brand Identity:
       * To-Do: Update the Tailwind CSS configuration to use the specific brand colors defined in the PRD. Create and
         integrate the "N-hook" logo.
   * ðŸ”´ Dark Mode Toggle:
       * To-Do: Implement a theme-switching capability in the React frontend.
