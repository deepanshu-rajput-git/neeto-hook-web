Prompt 01: Project Scaffolding & Structure
I want to build a fullstack application named `NeetoHook`.

Tech stack:
- Ruby on Rails for backend (API-only mode)
- React frontend (can be inside /frontend or connected via Vite)
- Tailwind CSS for UI
- PostgreSQL as the database

Please generate shell commands and folder structure to:
1. Create a new Rails API-only app
2. Add React with Vite bundler
3. Set up Tailwind CSS in React
4. Connect both for development (dev script/proxy)
5. Enable CORS in Rails for React frontend


Prompt 02: Webhook API Endpoints in Rails
In the Rails API app for NeetoHook, I want to handle webhooks.

Create the following:
1. A `WebhookRequest` model with fields:
   - method:string
   - headers:text (stored as JSON)
   - body:text
   - status:integer (default 200)
   - ip_address:string

2. A controller `WebhookRequestsController` with:
   - POST /hooks → stores incoming request
   - GET /hooks → returns paginated JSON of recent requests
   - GET /hooks/:id → returns detailed request

3. A serializer using ActiveModel::Serializer
4. Validations and proper error handling
5. JSON API response format

Also include:
- A migration file
- Routes
- Seeds (optional dummy hooks)


 Prompt 03: Frontend UI in React
 Create the React frontend of NeetoHook that includes:

Pages:
- Dashboard: shows list of incoming webhook requests
- Hook Details: view full payload/headers of a specific webhook

Components:
- HeaderBar
- Sidebar (navigation)
- HookTable (paginated)
- HookDetailsViewer

Features:
- Consume the Rails API from localhost (proxy setup)
- Tailwind styling
- Responsive layout with sidebar + top bar
- Dark mode toggle (optional)


Prompt 04: Real-Time Streaming with WebSockets
Implement live streaming of webhook requests using ActionCable and WebSocket.

Rails Backend:
1. Create a `WebhookChannel` that broadcasts new `WebhookRequest`
2. Use ActiveJob to broadcast after a webhook is saved
3. Secure ActionCable connection

React Frontend:
1. Connect via WebSocket (use native WebSocket or socket.io-client)
2. On receiving event, append new row to HookTable
3. Show a toast or badge for new incoming requests


Prompt 05: Payload Transformation via UI + Backend
I want to allow users to define simple transformations on incoming webhook payloads.

Rails:
- Add a `transformation_rules` table with:
  - name, rule_type (JS/regex), body, user_id (optional)
- Apply transformation in controller before saving payload
- Allow disabling/enabling rules

React:
- Create a UI to manage transformation rules
- Rule editor (text editor using Monaco/CodeMirror)
- Associate transformation to a hook endpoint

Prompt 06: Auth + Rate Limiting + Security
Secure the NeetoHook app:
1. Add JWT-based API authentication (use Knock/Devise-JWT)
2. Add rate limiting using Rack::Attack for /hooks
3. Protect ActionCable with authentication
4. Add CORS policy for frontend domain
5. Add audit logs for incoming requests (ip, time, etc)

Prompt 07: Deployment & CI/CD
Help me deploy the fullstack app to Fly.io or Render.

1. Dockerfile for Rails API and separate for React (or combine)
2. fly.toml or render.yaml
3. GitHub Actions workflow:
   - Backend: run tests + deploy on main push
   - Frontend: lint + deploy
4. Seed sample data and environment setup scripts

Prompt 08: Metrics, Analytics & Logging
Add observability to the app:
- Backend:
  - Integrate Skylight or NewRelic
  - Log incoming hook count, processing time
- Frontend:
  - Add simple dashboard: total hooks received, today, success/fail
  - Track latency between webhook and broadcast

  Prompt 09: Documentation Generator
  Create in-app and developer documentation:
1. Swagger/OpenAPI docs for all Rails endpoints
2. Markdown-based API explorer page in React
3. CLI tool to test endpoints (optional bonus)


Prompt 10: Test Coverage (RSpec + React Testing Library)
Help write test suites:
- RSpec tests for Webhook controller
- Model validations for WebhookRequest
- Broadcast job specs
- React Testing Library tests for:
  - HookTable component
  - HookDetailsViewer
  - RuleEditor form
