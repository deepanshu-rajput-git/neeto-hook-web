**Logo Idea:** A stylized ‚Äúhook‚Äù forming the letter "N", minimalist and developer-friendly.

8.1 Tech Stack
‚Ä¢ **Backend:** Ruby on Rails (API-only mode) ‚Äî Fast backend setup, ActiveJob for retries, ActionCable for live updates.‚Ä¢ **Frontend:** React (with Vite) ‚Äî Component-driven architecture, Tailwind CSS for styling.‚Ä¢ **Communication:** JSON API over REST, WebSockets for live logs.‚Ä¢ **Bundler:** Vite.js (preferred for Rails 7+ React setups).

## 1. üß≠ Purpose

**NeetoHook** aims to simplify the process of testing, inspecting, forwarding, mocking, and reliably delivering webhooks. It is a developer-first platform that combines live inspection, customizable behavior, local tunneling, and serverless transformations‚Äîall from one dashboard.

---

## 2. üîß Problem Statement

Modern applications rely heavily on webhooks for real-time communication. However:

- Developers often struggle to test and debug webhooks, especially on local environments.
- Existing tools are either too simple (no forwarding/logic) or too complex (requires infra setup).
- Handling retries, delivery guarantees, and transformations is often manual and error-prone.

- ‚úÖ Define response body, status code, headers, and delay

### üì§ Email & DNS Testing

- ‚úÖ **Temporary email addresses**
- ‚úÖ **DNS endpoint testing** (e.g., for webhook callbacks on DNS changes)

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliability

- ‚úÖ Webhook queue with audit log
- ‚úÖ Configurable retry policies per endpoint

### üîí Security

- ‚úÖ API key-based access

## 6. üß≠ User Flows

### Flow 1: Quick Test Webhook

1. User visits NeetoHook, gets a URL
2. Sends a `POST` to the URL
3. Sees request in live dashboard
4. Optionally forwards payload to production/staging

### Flow 2: Transform + Forward

1. Define transformation rules (e.g., rename keys)
2. Forward payload to internal service
3. If 500 error, retry 3 times

### Flow 3: Localhost Debugging

1. Start tunnel CLI: `NeetoHook tunnel --port 4000`
2. Get HTTPS public URL
3. Point webhook to it
4. Receive real-time data in local dev environment

---

## 7. üì¶ Scope

### In Scope

- Webhook inspection, forwarding, and transformation
- Local dev tunneling
- User dashboard with history
- CLI and REST API
- Basic team management

### Out of Scope (for MVP)

- Full no-code automation builder (like Zapier)
- SDKs in all languages (provide JS/Python first)

---

## 8. üß± Dependencies

- Node.js backend with Express + WebSocket
- React frontend with Tailwind
- PostgreSQL + Redis
- Secure tunnel agent (based on Go)
- Serverless functions runtime (e.g., via Deno/VM2)
